# Yarn (Test & Lint)

Most Javascript/Typescript packages or applications will use Npm or Yarn as their package manager. I have chosen to standardize my own repositories on Yarn.

Generally, repositories will want to run their specified `test` and `lint` scripts through the package manager to verify the correctness of new changes. This workflow makes it simple to run these commands in a GitHub Actions Workflow.

## Features

#### Matrix Strategy

The workflow uses a Matrix Strategy declaration which makes it simple to run multiple workflows in parallel for different Node.js versions.

#### Dependency Caching

The workflow uses GitHub's standard [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) action to cache the downloaded yarn dependencies.

It is **no longer** based on their standard [example](https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/master/examples.md#node---yarn) config. Caching the `.yarn/cache` directory was still taking nearly the full time to run a `yarn install`.

Based on [this article](https://dev.to/mpocock1/how-to-cache-nodemodules-in-github-actions-with-yarn-24eh) I've switch to caching the `node_modules` directory itself instead of the cache. This reduces the install time to 1-2 seconds if a cache hit occured.

The cache key is generated by hashing the `yarn.lock` file. You will get a cache miss (and re-install) if you update the yarn dependencies.

## Improvements

I would like to improve this workflow into more modular jobs. That way you get more easily distinguished output in the Actions Tab.
